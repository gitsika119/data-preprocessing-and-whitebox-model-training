# Data Preprocessing and Whitebox Model Training

## Project Desciption: 
Given a fictional corrupted dataset on who survived the Titanic, the aim of this project is to clean the dataset so that they only have relevant features. The data has been corrupted such that it'll have missing values, duplicate values, incorrect and incompatible types etc.
